	<string name="macQuestion"><![CDATA[
		Would you like to activate MAC checks?<br />
		By default, Android <i>only</i> checks the name of a network before connecting to it.<br />
		That means that if you have a network saved, and Android detects another network with the same name, Android automatically tries to connect to it.<br />
		A malicious device could use this to collect passwords or send harmful data to your device.<br />
		Checking it thus helps verify a network\'s identity.<br />
		It is strongly recommended that you enable this, but it means a few additional warnings will be shown.

			<h1>Permissions</h1>
			The permissions which WiFi Better Battery requests on your device have been chosen with great care. All permissions are necessary for its full functionality.<br />
			Just in case you still have concerns we have listed all requested permissions below, each with an explanation of why we need it.<br /><br />
			<b>Network permissions:</b> Necessary to list all available networks and to connect to networks.<br />
			<b>Internet:</b> Used only for Google ads.<br />
		]]></item>
		<item><![CDATA[
			<h1>Available networks</h1>
			After opening the app, the first thing you see is the list of available networks. WiFi does not have to be turned on for this function.<br />
			You can see the names and signal strengths of the networks here. When you tap on a network, the options for it are displayed.
			<h1>Warnings</h1>
			If the MAC check is enabled in the Settings, you may get a warning when connecting. For more information please consult the \"Networks\" help.<br />
			For connection problems, please follow the instructions offered by the Android system settings.

		<item><![CDATA[
			<h1>Saved networks</h1>
			Here you can edit your saved networks and corresponding MAC addresses.
			This function is most useful if the MAC check is enabled in the Settings (recommended!).
			<h1>MAC check</h1>
			The MAC check is an added check whether the network you want to connect to is actually the one you think it is.<br />
			By default, Android <i>only</i> checks the name of a network before connecting to it.<br />
			That means that if you have a network saved, and Android detects another network with the same name, Android automatically tries to connect to it.<br />
			A malicious device could use this to collect passwords that are sent during connection attempts or send harmful data to your device.<br />
			A MAC address uniquely identifies a device.
			<h1>How it works</h1>
			When connecting to a network and when the MAC check is on, Wifi Better Battery automatically checks whether the MAC address is known for this network.<br />
			In \"Networks\" you can delete known networks and MAC addresses that you have added at an earlier time.
